//things to initialize and libraries to import:
1. lcd
2. wifi network
3. distance sensor pins
4. relay pins
5. timing

void setup() {
1. init serial console
2. init the lcd
3. init the network
 - check the wifi module
 - check the wifi module firmware version
 - attempt connection
 - if connection ok - start the basic web server
 - print the network status to serial console and the lcd
4. init the sensor pins
5. init the relay pins
}

void loop() {
1. setup the web server and monitor periodicaly the network status (PO4TI PYLNA MYGLA)
2. sensor - relay loop:
 - assign the result from sensor function (defined outside of loop function),
   as a value of a variable called "distance"
   //in case something wrong with sensor:
 - if (distance is 0 or lower) || (distance >= tank height) => relay pin set to HIGH (relay contacts are open, pump is off)
   //in case the water level is at desired maximum:
 - else if (distance <= 10cm) => relay pin set to HIGH (relay contacts are open, pump is off)
   //in all other cases pump is turned on:
 - else => relay pin set to LOW (relay contacts are closed, pump is on)
 
 //serial console and lcd display showing the measured distance and the status of the relay:
3. serial console & lcd loop:
 - if ((distance is 0 or lower) || (distance >= tank height))  && (relay pin state == HIGH) => serial console print Xcm - out of range, pump off, and call lcdSensorOut() function
 - else if (distance <= 10cm) && (relay pin state == HIGH) => serial console print Xcm - tank full, pump off, and call lcdSensorFull() function
 - else serial console print Xcm - tank filling, pump on, and call lcdSensorFilling() function
 
 TO DO HERE: Find a way to implement a timer function to initiate #1 and #2 for 2 min (120000 ms) then wait for 1 h (3600000 ms) without pausing the entire program!!!!!

// LCD FUNCTIONS:
1. lcd init message at arduino startup.
2. lcd connecting  message while trying to connect to the network
3. lcd connect success message
4. lcd wifi module error message
5. lcd wifi module firmware update message
6. lcd out of range message
7. lcd tank full message
8. lcd tank filling message

// NETWORK FUNCTIONS:
1. get ip address after connection success
2. get the ssid of the network and the rssi of the signal

// SERVER FUNCTIONS:
1. running a webpage with relay pin status and manual turning on/off of the pump (CHASTICHNO RABOTESHTO, HTML + JAVA SCRIPT + AJAX V C++ - super kombinaciq za noobs, kato men)

// SENSOR FUNCTION:
1. turn raw data from sensor into distance in cm
